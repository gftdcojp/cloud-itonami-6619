  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the card-processing analog of `cloud-
  itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- transaction intake allowed, every
                                 write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-assess  -- adds jurisdiction assessment + fraud
                                 screening writes, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:transaction/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:settlement/
                                 finalize`/`:chargeback/release` NEVER
                                 auto-commit, at any phase.

  `:settlement/finalize`/`:chargeback/release` are deliberately
  ABSENT from every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a
  permanent structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come.
  Finalizing a real settlement and releasing a real chargeback hold
  are the two real-world legal acts this actor performs; both are
  always a human processor officer's call. `card.governor`'s
  `:actuation/settle-transaction`/`:actuation/release-chargeback`
  high-stakes gate enforces the same invariant independently -- two
  layers, not one, agree on this. `:fraud/screen` is likewise never
  auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same posture every sibling's
  screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only ONE member
  (`:transaction/intake`) -- this domain has no separate no-capital-
  risk 'file' lifecycle distinct from the transaction record itself.")
