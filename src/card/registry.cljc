  "Pure-function settlement-finalization + chargeback-release record
  construction -- an append-only card-processor book-of-record draft.

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single
  international check-digit standard for a settlement-finalization or
  chargeback-release reference number -- every processor/jurisdiction
  assigns its own reference format. This namespace does NOT invent
  one; it builds a jurisdiction-scoped sequence number and validates
  the record's required fields, the same honest, non-fabricating
  discipline `card.facts` uses.

  `settlement-amount-exceeds-authorized?` is the THIRD non-temporal
  instance of this fleet's MAXIMUM-ceiling check family (`facility.
  registry/occupancy-exceeds-capacity?` established the first,
  `school.registry/class-size-exceeds-maximum?` the second), directly
  implementing this blueprint's own stated Trust Control: 'partial
  approvals never over-charge the granted amount' -- a transaction's
  own settlement amount must never exceed its own authorized amount.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real card-processing/settlement system, and it never
  touches a raw PAN (see README `Actuation` -- tokenization is the
  operator's own responsibility at the edge, out of scope for this
  actor). It builds the RECORD a processor would keep, not the act of
  finalizing the settlement or releasing the chargeback hold itself
  (that is `card.operation`'s `:settlement/finalize`/`:chargeback/
  release`, always human-gated)."
