(ns card.store
  "SSoT for the card actor, behind a `Store` protocol so the backend
  is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every prior `cloud-
  itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses:

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see langchain.kotoba-db).

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/card/store_contract_test.clj), which is the whole point: the
  actor, the Card Settlement Governor and the audit ledger never know
  which SSoT they run on.

  Like `hospital.store`'s dual treatment/discharge history and every
  other dual-actuation sibling before it, this actor has TWO actuation
  events (finalizing a settlement, releasing a chargeback hold) acting
  on the SAME entity (a transaction), each with its OWN history
  collection, sequence counter and dedicated double-actuation-guard
  boolean (`:settled?`/`:chargeback-released?`, never a `:status`
  value) -- the same discipline every prior sibling governor's guards
  establish, informed by `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s status-lifecycle
  bug (ADR-2607071320).

  This store deliberately carries NO raw PAN (Primary Account Number)
  field at all -- see README `Actuation`/`Scope`: tokenization at the
  edge is the operator's own responsibility, entirely out of scope for
  this actor, so there is no PAN field to omit-by-convention, there is
  simply no such field in the schema.

  The ledger stays append-only on every backend: 'which transaction
  was screened for an unresolved fraud flag, which settlement was
  finalized, which chargeback hold was released, on what
  jurisdictional basis, approved by whom' is always a query over an
  immutable log -- the audit trail a merchant/cardholder trusting a
  processor needs, and the evidence an operator needs if a settlement
  or chargeback release is later disputed."
